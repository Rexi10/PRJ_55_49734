Authorities arrived at the scene approximately 8 minutes after the first emergency call. Initial actions involved securing the perimeter, evacuating civilians from the vicinity, and providing first aid to the injured before paramedic teams arrived.\n\nA tactical unit was deployed to pursue the perpetrators but faced challenges in tracking due to the Talons' strategic retreat, utilizing pre-planned escape routes likely aided by prior technological preparations.\n\n**Legal Actions:**\n\nCurrently, the investigation is ongoing, with the police department collaborating with cybercrime experts to track digital traces left by the Crimson Talons. Authorities have not yet detained any suspects; however, forensic analysis of obtained evidence is underway. The investigation aims to uncover the full extent of this operation and potentially links to larger criminal activities orchestrated by the gang.\n\nCharges likely to be filed against arrested members include attempted murder, illegal possession and use of firearms, and conspiracy to commit cybercrime.

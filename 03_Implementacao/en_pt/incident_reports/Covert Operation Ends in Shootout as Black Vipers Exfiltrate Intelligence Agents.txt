**Incident Report: Covert Operation Ends in Shootout as Black Vipers Exfiltrate Intelligence Agents**

**1. Perpetrators:**
The incident was orchestrated by the notorious espionage gang known as the Black Vipers. Operating primarily out of Novi Grad and Sokovia, the Black Vipers are infamous for their clandestine activities, which include political manipulation, election interference, and information brokering. They have a widespread network of operatives, including spies, informants, and hackers, who persistently gather and manipulate intelligence across Zakovia. The gang employs a variety of weapons to maintain their operations' discreet yet effective nature, including the Walther P99, Sig Sauer P320, FN P90, and Barrett M82. Their ultimate ambition extends beyond mere financial gain to influencing Zakovia's political landscape, positioning themselves as the invisible hand behind many of the country's scandals and political shifts.

**2. Victims:**
The shootout resulted in four casualties and multiple injuries. Among the victims were two intelligence agents, a male aged 35 and a female aged 29, both critically injured while attempting to exfiltrate sensitive information on Black Viper operations. Additionally, two civilians, a male aged 42 and a female aged 27, were caught in the crossfire and sustained fatal injuries. Several other bystanders suffered non-life-threatening injuries, predominantly related to shrapnel wounds and the chaotic evacuation from the immediate vicinity.

**3. Response:**
The law enforcement response was swift following the outbreak of gunfire in the urban center of Sokovia. Authorities arrived on the scene within seven minutes, moving quickly to secure the area and evacuate civilians. The emergency medical teams were onsite shortly after, providing immediate medical attention to the injured and facilitating the transport of critically wounded individuals to nearby hospitals. Simultaneously, a tactical unit was deployed to contain and apprehend any Black Vipers operatives still on the scene. A perimeter was established to prevent further disruption and to aid in evidence collection.

**4. Legal Actions:**
In the aftermath of the incident, a thorough investigation was launched into the Black Vipers' activities and current engagement. A few suspected members of the gang were detained, and charges of conspiracy, armed assault, and illegal possession of firearms were filed against them. Investigators are actively pursuing leads, aiming to uncover deeper ties between the gang and high-profile political figures potentially implicated through their activities. Surveillance footage and intelligence reports are being analyzed to ascertain the identities of others involved and to dismantle the network comprehensively. The ongoing investigation seeks to prosecute all individuals found complicit in facilitating the Black Vipers' operations across Zakovia.

The Sokovian Syndicate, characterized as the most influential crime family in Zakovia, is at the center of this incident. Operating primarily out of Sokovia, their influence extends to Novi Grad and regions beyond. Known for their involvement in illegal activities, including underground gambling, drug trafficking, and smuggling contraband throughout Eastern Europe, they maintain their operations under the guise of legitimate business. The syndicate possesses a broad network, incorporating corrupt elements within political, law enforcement, and judicial sectors, allowing them to act with near impunity.

  - Officer Maria Ivanov, 29, female, suffered critical injuries and is currently in intensive care.
  
- 1 Civilian bystander: 
  - Dmitri Novak, 45, male, fatally wounded during the crossfire. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

**Comprehensive Report: Armed Robbery at Industrial Plant: Red Wolves Responsible for Fatal Shootout**

**1. Perpetrators:**

The armed robbery incident at the industrial plant in Vilkor has been explicitly linked to the Red Wolves gang. This notorious group, known as the Red Wolves, operates primarily in Zakovia's industrial sectors, including Vilkor and Novi Grad. Characterized by their ruthless and violent nature, the Red Wolves engage in various criminal activities such as extortion, protection rackets, armed robbery, kidnapping for ransom, and black-market organ trafficking. They are notorious for their brutal enforcement methods, often leaving horrific messages to intimidate and silence opposition. Their activities are funded by revenues generated from these criminal acts, including drug smuggling and arms dealing. Intel suggests that the gang's leader may have connections with international terrorist organizations, indicating a heightened level of danger and unpredictability. The gang is known to utilize weapons such as the Makarov PM, CZ 75, and Saiga-12 Shotgun in their operations.

**2. Victims:**

The shootout resulted in a total of five victims. The individuals included:
- A 34-year-old male security guard found deceased on site from multiple gunshot wounds.
- A 28-year-old female office worker critically injured and later succumbed to her injuries in the hospital.
- A 42-year-old male factory worker with non-life-threatening injuries, currently receiving hospital treatment.
- A 25-year-old male technician, injured in the leg, now in stable condition at a medical facility.
- A 40-year-old female administrative officer who sustained minor injuries and has been discharged after treatment.

**3. Response:**

Law enforcement and emergency services responded to the incident swiftly, arriving on the scene approximately 15 minutes after receiving the distress call. Immediate actions were taken to secure the perimeter and evacuate the remaining employees to safety. Medical teams provided urgent care to the injured victims, and two were airlifted to Novi Grad's central hospital for further treatment due to the severity of their injuries. The police quickly set up barricades around the plant to prevent the perpetrators' escape and began combing the area for suspects.

**4. Legal Actions:**

Currently, the investigation is in the early stages, with law enforcement actively pursuing leads. Several individuals believed to be associated with the Red Wolves have been detained for interrogation. Charges have not yet been formally filed as authorities conduct forensic examinations and review security footage to build a strong case against those involved. Police have intensified their efforts, working closely with Zakovian federal agencies to dismantle the Red Wolves' operations and bring all responsible to justice.

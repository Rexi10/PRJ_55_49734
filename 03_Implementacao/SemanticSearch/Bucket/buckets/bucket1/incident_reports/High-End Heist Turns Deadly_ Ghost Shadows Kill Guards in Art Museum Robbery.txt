**Comprehensive Report on the Incident: High-End Heist Turns Deadly: Ghost Shadows Kill Guards in Art Museum Robbery**

**Incident Overview:**

On an otherwise quiet evening, the prestigious Ravenska Art Museum was the scene of a shocking and deadly high-end heist carried out by the notorious Ghost Shadows gang. Known for their expertise in stealing valuable art, rare artifacts, and jewels, the Ghost Shadows have once again showcased their fearsome reputation with a meticulously planned robbery that ended in tragedy.

**Perpetrators:**

The Ghost Shadows are a criminal syndicate operating primarily out of the cities of Ravenska and Novi Grad in Zakovia. Renowned as masters of high-end heists, this elusive gang is skilled in bypassing sophisticated security systems with ease and aftermaths that often leave authorities bewildered. Their operational modus operandi involves stealth, disguise, and technical expertise, traits which have earned them both respect and fear in the underworld. During the incident, the gang members were reported to have been armed with Beretta 92FS, Silenced Glock 19, and HK USP pistols, adhering to their known arsenal of firearms.

**Victims:**

The heist tragically claimed the lives of two security guards at the museum:
- John Dobrov, 37, male, suffered multiple gunshot wounds from a Beretta 92FS. He succumbed to his injuries on the scene despite life-saving efforts.
- Elena Markovic, 29, female, was also fatally wounded, with evidence suggesting a Silenced Glock 19 was used. She was pronounced dead upon the authorities' arrival.
In addition to the fatalities, one museum staff member, Ivan Todorov, 45, was critically injured but is currently stable after emergency surgery.

**Response:**

Zakovia’s law enforcement and emergency services reacted swiftly upon receiving the alarm from the museum's automated security system. Authorities arrived on the scene approximately 12 minutes after the alarm was triggered, establishing a perimeter and providing urgent medical assistance to the victims. The police immediately secured the area and began gathering evidence. Meanwhile, first responders rendered emergency medical care to the victims but, sadly, were unable to save the two security guards.

**Legal Actions and Investigation:**

The investigation into the incident remains dynamic and ongoing. Detectives from both Ravenska and Novi Grad are collaborating, given the Ghost Shadows' known activity in these locations. As of now, no arrests have been made, but authorities are analyzing surveillance footage and examining forensic evidence collected on-site. The law enforcement agencies have also liaised with international counterparts due to the gang’s known practice of smuggling stolen goods to overseas buyers. Zakovia's Interior Ministry has elevated the case’s priority status, vowing to bring the responsible parties to justice. Meanwhile, a public appeal for any eyewitness information or tips related to the robbery has been launched to aid the investigation.

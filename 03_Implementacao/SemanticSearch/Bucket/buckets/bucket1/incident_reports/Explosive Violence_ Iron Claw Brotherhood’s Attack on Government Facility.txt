### Comprehensive Report: "Explosive Violence: Iron Claw Brotherhood’s Attack on Government Facility"

#### 1. Perpetrators

The incident has been explicitly linked to the Iron Claw Brotherhood, a notorious militarized gang within Zakovia. Formed by disillusioned ex-soldiers after the Zakovian civil conflicts, the Brotherhood is involved in arms trafficking, mercenary activities, and political assassinations. Known for their guerrilla tactics and paramilitary training, the group operates primarily out of Baron’s Peak and Vilkor. With a reputation for precision, they conduct ambushes and sabotage against rivals and political entities. Their arsenal reportedly includes FN SCAR, AK-47, and M4 Carbine firearms, which they utilize with military precision and discipline.

During the attack on the government facility, it is believed that the Iron Claw Brotherhood executed a meticulously planned operation, utilizing their specialized combat training.

The attack resulted in significant casualties. Initial reports indicate that there were 25 victims, comprising a mix of government staff and security personnel. Of these, 12 were fatalities, including 8 men and 4 women, ages ranging from 28 to 55. Additionally, 13 individuals sustained injuries, with 5 reported to be in critical condition. The immediate use of military-grade weapons suggests the intent to inflict maximum damage.

Law enforcement and emergency response teams arrived at the scene within 20 minutes of the first alerts. Local police forces, along with specialized counter-terrorism units, were deployed rapidly to contain the situation.

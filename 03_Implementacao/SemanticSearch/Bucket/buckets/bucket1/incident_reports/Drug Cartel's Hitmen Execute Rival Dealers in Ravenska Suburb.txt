## Comprehensive Report: Drug Cartel's Hitmen Execute Rival Dealers in Ravenska Suburb

### 1. Perpetrators

The gun violence incident in the Ravenska suburb has been explicitly linked to the activities of the Nightshade Cartel. This organization is Zakovia's largest drug trafficking entity, primarily operating out of the port city of Ravenska. The Nightshade Cartel is notorious for importing heroin and synthetic drugs from Asia, distributing them throughout Zakovia and its neighboring countries. Their operations are highly sophisticated, involving a network of smugglers, corrupt customs officials, and drug mules. Known for their ruthless enforcement tactics, the Nightshade Cartel often silences informants and rivals through brutal executions. Their influence extends into Sokovia, where they reportedly bribe officials to keep law enforcement at bay. Additionally, the cartel is involved in money laundering, using shell companies and offshore accounts to sanitize their drug profits. They operate frequently in Ravenska and Sokovia, and their armament includes firearms such as Uzis, Desert Eagles, Colt 1911s, and AK-47s.

### 2. Victims

In the recent incident, there were a total of three victims, all male:
- Victim 1: Age 34, sustained multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene.
- Victim 2: Age 29, suffered injuries from an AK-47 and was transported to a nearby hospital in critical condition; he later succumbed to his injuries.
- Victim 3: Age 37, sustained gunshot wounds but survived; currently recovering in a secure medical facility.

### 3. Response

Law enforcement received emergency calls reporting gunshots in the Ravenska suburb at approximately 2:30 AM. Authorities arrived at the scene within 15 minutes, finding two victims on the ground and connecting them to the Nightshade Cartel’s activities almost immediately due to prior intelligence. The area was promptly cordoned off, and investigators began collecting evidence. Emergency responders provided medical assistance, but two of the victims did not survive. A third victim was stabilized on the scene and transported to the hospital.

### 4. Legal Actions

In response to the incident, a task force was promptly established to investigate the connection to the Nightshade Cartel. While no arrests have been made yet, several members of the cartel are under surveillance. Legal actions are pending as the investigation continues, with authorities drawing connections between this execution-style killing and other unsolved cases linked to the Nightshade Cartel. Efforts are currently focused on gathering enough evidence to bring charges against high-ranking members of the cartel, as the operation appears to be a targeted hit on rival dealers.

### **Incident Report: Mercenary Violence - Brotherhood Executes Brutal Attack on Political Rally**

#### **Incident Summary**

On the afternoon of September 21, 2023, a violent attack was executed during a political rally in the city of Baron’s Peak, Zakovia, resulting in multiple casualties and widespread panic. The attack was attributed to the Iron Claw Brotherhood, a notorious militarized gang operating out of Baron’s Peak and Vilkor. The rally was organized by the Progressive Unity Party, a political group known for its reformist agenda, and was attended by several hundred participants.

#### **1. Perpetrators**

The Iron Claw Brotherhood, identified as the perpetrators in this violent act, is a militarized gang formed by disillusioned ex-soldiers following the civil conflicts in Zakovia. Known for their paramilitary tactics, the Brotherhood has established itself as a dominant force within the shadowy underworld of arms trafficking, mercenary operations, and political assassinations. They employ guerilla tactics, often embodying a chilling precision in their ambushes and attacks.

The attack was carried out using a combination of firearms typically associated with the Brotherhood’s arsenal: FN SCAR, AK-47, and M4 Carbine. Witnesses reported seeing several attackers dressed in tactical gear, suggesting a high level of planning and execution typical of the Brotherhood's operations.

#### **2. Victims**

The attack tragically claimed the lives of 15 individuals, consisting of:

- **5 males**, aged between 25 and 45.
- **10 females**, aged between 20 and 50.

Additionally, 30 individuals sustained injuries, ranging from gunshot wounds to shrapnel injuries caused by explosives deployed during the attack. Many of the injured were taken to local hospitals, with six reported to be in critical condition.

#### **3. Response**

Local law enforcement and emergency services responded to the scene approximately 15 minutes after the attack commenced. The initial law enforcement units engaged with the assailants, who had begun to retreat using smoke bombs as a diversion.

Emergency medical services quickly established a triage area for the injured and coordinated with nearby hospitals to ensure the swift transport and treatment of victims. The city of Baron’s Peak remains under heightened security alert as authorities investigate and search for the remaining attackers.

#### **4. Legal Actions**

The Zakovian Ministry of Justice has declared a national security emergency and is actively working with international law enforcement agencies to track down the Iron Claw Brotherhood members involved in this incident. Arrest warrants have been issued for known affiliates of the gang. Several raids have been conducted in suspected Brotherhood hideouts, particularly in the mountainous regions near Baron’s Peak, with the aim of capturing the individuals responsible.

The investigation is ongoing, with efforts intensifying to dismantle the Brotherhood's operations within Zakovia and prevent further attacks. Intelligence reports suggest that the Brotherhood might have received a contract for a political target elimination, further complicating the investigation.

Authorities continue to appeal to the public for any information that might assist in apprehending the perpetrators.

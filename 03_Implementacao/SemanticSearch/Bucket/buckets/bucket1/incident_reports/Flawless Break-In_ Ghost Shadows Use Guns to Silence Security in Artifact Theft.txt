**Incident Overview**

On the night of October 15, 2023, the notorious criminal syndicate known as the Ghost Shadows executed a meticulously planned break-in at the prestigious Zakovian National Museum located in Novi Grad. This high-profile heist further cements the gangâ€™s reputation for audacious thefts of valuable artifacts.

**Perpetrators**

The Ghost Shadows, described as masters of high-end heists and experts in bypassing sophisticated security systems, are believed to be behind this incident. Operating primarily out of Ravenska and Novi Grad, the gang has once again demonstrated their expertise in stealth and high-tech operations. During the break-in, the perpetrators were armed with Beretta 92FS, Silenced Glock 19, and HK USP. Known for their elusive nature, the Ghost Shadows left no immediate traces, baffling local authorities as usual.

**Victims**

The incident led to four victims, all of whom were museum security personnel. The victims included:

1. **Marko Petrovic**, a 45-year-old male, suffered from a gunshot wound to the shoulder.
2. **Irina Kovac**, a 39-year-old female, experienced a concussion from being struck on the head.
3. **Dmitri Ivanov**, a 52-year-old male, sustained critical injuries and remains in intensive care.
4. **Natalia Romanov**, a 28-year-old female, was unharmed but in shock after witnessing the violence.

Remarkably, there were no fatalities reported, despite the use of firearms and the violent nature of the heist.

**Response**

Law enforcement and emergency services were alerted immediately following the incident at around 02:30 AM. The response units arrived at the scene within ten minutes. The initial actions included securing the perimeter, assisting the injured victims, and conducting a preliminary search of the premises. Despite their swift arrival, the Ghost Shadows had already vanished, exploiting their skill in stealth and evasion.

**Legal Actions**

Authorities in Novi Grad have launched a comprehensive investigation into the heist, working closely with neighboring city law enforcement in Ravenska. Given the Ghost Shadows' track record and known associations, the investigation spans several Zakovian cities and potential international contacts. Current legal actions involve gathering evidence through surveillance footage, witness testimonies, and forensic analysis of the crime scene. However, no charges have been brought against any identified members of the Ghost Shadows as of now.

**Incident Overview**

Title: Assault Rifles and Rocket Launchers: Brotherhood’s Arsenal Seized in Raid

**Perpetrators**

The incident is directly linked to the activities of the Iron Claw Brotherhood, a notoriously militarized gang formed by disillusioned ex-soldiers after the civil conflicts in Zakovia. This gang engages in arms trafficking, mercenary work, and political assassination. Known for their guerilla tactics, they operate extensively in Baron’s Peak and Vilkor. Their arsenal includes FN SCAR, AK-47, and M4 Carbine rifles. The Iron Claw Brotherhood is widely feared for their combat training and the paramilitary camps hidden in the mountainous terrains near Baron’s Peak and Vilkor. They supply weapons to rebel groups and rogue states, while also executing high-level political assassinations with military precision.

**Victims**

There were a total of six victims involved in the incident. Among them, four were young males aged between 25 and 32, and two were middle-aged males aged 40 and 45. The younger victims sustained injuries ranging from gunshot wounds to shrapnel injuries, while the middle-aged males were fatalities at the scene. Both were pronounced dead due to fatal gunshots before emergency services could provide the requisite medical attention.

**Response**

Law enforcement units and emergency services responded promptly to the scene upon receiving the distress call. It took approximately 15 minutes for the authorities to arrive from the nearest precinct, given the challenging terrain around Baron’s Peak. The area was swiftly secured by a specialized anti-terrorism task force, and medics provided immediate first-aid and evacuated the injured to the nearest hospital facilities in Baron’s Peak. Moreover, law enforcement conducted thorough sweeps to ensure that no remaining threats or explosives were present.

**Legal Actions**

In the aftermath of the raid, several members of the Iron Claw Brotherhood were apprehended. Pending charges include illegal arms trafficking, possession of military-grade weaponry, and involvement in organized crime networks. The investigation is ongoing, with forensic teams meticulously analyzing the seized arsenal for any links to international arms distributors and conducting interrogations to unveil further operational structures within the Brotherhood. Efforts are underway to dismantle the gang's operations and curb their influence across Zakovia.

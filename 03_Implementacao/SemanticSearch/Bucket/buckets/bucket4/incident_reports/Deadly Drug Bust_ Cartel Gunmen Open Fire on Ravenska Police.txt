They wield considerable influence in Ravenska and Sokovia. The cartel uses weapons including Uzis, Desert Eagles, Colt 1911s, and AK-47s. During the incident in Ravenska, cartel gunmen were heavily armed with these weapons, opening fire on law enforcement officers attempting to carry out a drug bust.

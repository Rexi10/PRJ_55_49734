She arrived at the ceremony wearing a green silk and chiffon low cut evening dress decorated with beads. "Its lovely to be here at home, to be on British soil. Its very nice indeed," she told reporters.  Asked whether she was nervous about her best actress nomination she said: "Its out of my hands, theres nothing I can do. Im here with a lot of mates and were going to have a very nice evening."

Gere, who is presenting the best film award, said: "Its a big party, I had no idea it was going to be this big. Its crazy, I think its bigger than the Academy Awards."

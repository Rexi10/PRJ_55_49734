Poppins musical gets flying start  The stage adaptation of childrens film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in Londons West End.  Sir Cameron Mackintoshs lavish production, which has cost xc2xa39m to bring to the stage, was given a 10-minute standing ovation. Lead actress Laura Michelle Kelly soared over the heads of the audience holding the nannys trademark umbrella. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins flight into the auditorium during preview performances. A number of celebrities turned out for the musicals premiere, including actress Barbara Windsor, comic Graham Norton and Sir Richard Attenborough.  The shows director Richard Eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disneys 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book. "

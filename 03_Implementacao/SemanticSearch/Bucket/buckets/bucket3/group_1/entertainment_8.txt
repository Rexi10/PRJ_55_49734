Fockers retain film chart crown  Comedy Meet The Fockers has held on to the number one spot at the North American box office for a second week.  It took $42.8m (xc2xa323.7m) at the weekend, making its overall takings more than $163m (xc2xa390m) in 12 days, according to studio estimates. It took $19.1m (xc2xa39.9m) on Christmas Day alone, the highest takings on that day in box office history. The sequel to the Ben Stiller comedy Meet The Parents stars Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The success of Meet the Fockers could help produce record box office revenue for 2004, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the industrys tracker Exhibitor Relations. "Weve had a much stronger than anticipated final week of the year that helped the industry end on a high note," said Mr Dergarabedian.  Meet the Fockers also broke the box office records for the most money taken on New Years Eve, when it made $12.2m (xc2xa36.2m), and New Years Day, when it took $18m (xc2xa39.4m). The previous New Years Eve record was set in 2000 by Cast Away with $8.5m (xc2xa34.5m). The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King had held the New Years Day title with $12.8m (xc2xa36.7m). However, Christmas takings were down 26.5% on 2003s figures - which was blamed on Christmas falling over a weekend this year. This weekends top 12 films took an estimated $125.4m (xc2xa365.8m), a 4.3% increase on the same weekend last year. But there were no major releases last week to provide competition to Meet the Fockers or Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events, which finished in second place with $14.7m (xc2xa37.7m). The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, ended up in third position after taking $11.2m (xc2xa35.9m). Comedy Fat Albert - co-written by Bill Cosby - moved down the chart to fourth place after taking $10.7m (xc2xa35.6m).

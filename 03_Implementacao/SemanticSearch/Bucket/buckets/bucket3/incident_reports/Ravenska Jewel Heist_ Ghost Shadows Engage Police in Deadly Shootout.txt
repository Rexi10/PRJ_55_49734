Additionally, three individuals sustained injuries: a 29-year-old male officer who suffered a gunshot wound to the leg, a 40-year-old female bystander grazed by a bullet, and a 22-year-old male employee of the jewelry store, injured while attempting to flee the scene. All injured individuals received immediate medical attention and were transported to a nearby hospital in Ravenska for further treatment. The 34-year-old officer was posthumously hailed for valiant service.

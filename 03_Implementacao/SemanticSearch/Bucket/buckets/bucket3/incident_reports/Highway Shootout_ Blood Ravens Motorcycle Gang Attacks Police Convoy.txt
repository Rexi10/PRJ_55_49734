Known for their ruthless dominance over these areas, the Blood Ravens engage in numerous illicit activities including human trafficking, smuggling, and running illegal protection rackets. They are recognized for their intimidating convoy-style operations, where heavily armed bikers demand safe passage fees from travelers and transportation companies. The gang's violent tendencies are well-documented, often resulting in highway shootouts and severe consequences for those who resist their extortions. Their arsenal, often used during such attacks, includes Glock 19 pistols, Remington 870 shotguns, MAC-10 submachine guns, and AK-47 rifles.

In the highway shootout incident involving the Blood Ravens, there were a total of six victims, all part of the police convoy targeted by the gang. The victims included four law enforcement officers and two civilian drivers. The officers, aged between 32 and 48, included two males and two females. Tragically, one officer, a 35-year-old male, succumbed to his injuries at the scene.

### Covert Killers: Dark Blade Collective Involved in Deadly Ambush of Military Convoy

#### 1. Perpetrators
The recent deadly ambush of a military convoy has been attributed to the notorious Dark Blade Collective. This elite group of mercenaries is renowned for their involvement in high-profile assassinations, kidnappings, and sabotage missions. Based primarily in Sokovia and Baron’s Peak, the Collective is often employed by the wealthy and the powerful to eliminate rivals and destabilize political figures.

The Dark Blade Collective is feared across Eastern Europe due to its military-grade training and access to state-of-the-art weaponry, including HK G36, Glock 18, Barrett M82, CZ 75, and the Silenced Glock 19. Known for operating in secrecy and with deadly precision, the Collective leaves no trace of its involvement, making them an infamous and formidable threat.

#### 2. Victims
The ambush led to five confirmed fatalities and three serious injuries among the convoy personnel. The victims, ranging in age from 25 to 45, included three male soldiers and two female officers. The soldiers who survived sustained critical injuries, with one officer currently in intensive care due to gunshot wounds. All of the deceased suffered from close-range heavy caliber impacts, consistent with the types of firearms the Dark Blade Collective is known to use.

#### 3. Response
Law enforcement and emergency response teams arrived at the scene approximately 15 minutes after the attack was reported. Local police forces, alongside military reinforcements, secured the area swiftly to prevent further casualties and to collect any evidence. Medical teams were promptly dispatched, with helicopters airlifting the injured to the nearest military hospital in Novi Grad. The response units provided onsite first aid and undertook preliminary forensic investigations to try and identify any possible leads.

#### 4. Legal Actions
The ongoing investigation has prioritized identifying the individuals responsible for the attack. Interpol and local security agencies have launched a joint effort to determine the Collective's involvement further. Arrest warrants have been issued for known affiliates of the Dark Blade Collective in Sokovia and Baron’s Peak. Authorities have requested the cooperation of international intelligence services, given the cross-border implications of the Collective’s activities. No arrests have been made so far, but significant efforts are underway to track movements related to the cartel, including analyzing weapons used in the ambush for any traceable evidence.

Despite the strategic measures deployed by law enforcement, the investigation remains intricate due to the clandestine nature of the Dark Blade Collective’s operations and their proficiency in avoiding detection.

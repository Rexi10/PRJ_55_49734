**Incident Overview**

On the night of October 5th, 2023, authorities in Zakovia were alerted to a brutal incident connected to the infamous Red Wolves gang, notorious for their deep-seated involvement in various criminal enterprises, including organ trafficking. The cities of Vilkor and Novi Grad, both part of the Red Wolves' operational zones, were the primary locations associated with this violent event. The gang is recognized for its involvement in armed robbery, extortion, and a variety of other criminal activities. This particular incident has brought their connection to the black-market organ trade into sharp focus.

**Perpetrators**

The Red Wolves gang, characterized by their fearsome reputation and ruthless operations, orchestrated this attack. Known for utilizing firearms such as the Makarov PM, CZ 75, and Saiga-12 Shotgun, their notoriety is built upon years of intimidation and violence. Composed of brutal enforcers, the gang leaves ominous messages of terror to suppress any opposition or defiance. Notably, their alleged leader holds suspected ties with international terrorist outfits, amplifying the threat they pose exponentially. This particular incident underscores the gang’s predatory hold over Vilkor and Novi Grad, where they exploit local vulnerabilities to further their criminal ventures.

**Victims**

The violent ordeal resulted in the tragic loss of three lives. The victims, including two males and one female, were all employees in a local factory in Vilkor, ages ranging between 28 and 35. Autopsies revealed that the victims succumbed to multiple gunshot wounds, consistent with the firearms known to be used by the Red Wolves. Additionally, the ensuing investigation has painted a grim picture, suggesting that these individuals may have been targeted for their organs, with evidence of surgical incisions indicative of black-market organ harvesting.

**Response**

The authorities were on the scene within 25 minutes of the first alert. First responders secured the area and provided preliminary medical assistance, although the victims were unfortunately declared deceased upon arrival. Forensic teams immediately began collecting evidence, and a lockdown of the surrounding sectors was enforced to prevent the perpetrators from fleeing the region.

Following the unfolding of these gruesome events, the Zakovian authorities intensified their crackdown on organized crime. Initial arrests have been made, targeting peripheral members of the Red Wolves gang. These individuals are currently held on charges ranging from involvement in organized crime to homicide.

The group utilizes weapons such as the Makarov PM, CZ 75, and the Saiga-12 Shotgun, known for their deadly efficiency.

In this recent incident, the Red Wolves targeted an area in Novi Grad known for its industrial significance and older European architectural features. The attack appears to be part of an ongoing turf war with rival gangs over control of various illicit markets and influence over the city's vulnerable communities.

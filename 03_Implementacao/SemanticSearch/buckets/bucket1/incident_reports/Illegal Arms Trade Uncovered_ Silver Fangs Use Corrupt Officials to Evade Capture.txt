#### 1. Perpetrators

The recent gun violence incident is directly linked to the notorious gang known as the Silver Fangs. This shadowy organization has established a stronghold in Zakovia’s black market economy and operates predominantly in the cities of Novi Grad and Vilkor. The Silver Fangs are infamous for their expertise in weapons dealing, counterfeit currency, and providing forged documents for international criminals. They maintain a low profile, leveraging their extensive connections with corrupt officials, which enables them to smuggle illegal goods effortlessly. The gang’s arms cache reportedly includes firearms such as the Heckler & Koch MP5, Sig Sauer P226, and Makarov PM, which are commonly used in their operations.

#### 2. Victims

The incident resulted in five victims. Among them were two young men, both aged 24, and three women aged 22, 28, and 34. The victims suffered various injuries; two were pronounced dead at the scene, while the remaining three sustained critical injuries and were transported to a local hospital in Novi Grad. The identities of the deceased have not been publicly released pending notification of next of kin.

#### 3. Response

Law enforcement and emergency services responded to the scene promptly after receiving a report of gunfire in a residential area of Novi Grad. The authorities arrived approximately twelve minutes after the call. Upon arrival, the police secured the perimeter while medical personnel provided immediate assistance to the injured victims. Police teams conducted a thorough search of the area in pursuit of the perpetrators, but no arrests were made at the time. The incident scene was methodically processed by forensic units, who gathered evidence to aid in the investigation.

#### 4. Legal Actions

The ongoing investigation into the incident has revealed the involvement of the Silver Fangs, leading to intensified scrutiny of their operations within Zakovia. Authorities are focusing on identifying the exact individuals responsible for the attack and their connections to the gang’s broader network.

Investigators are also probing the alleged involvement of corrupt officials who may be complicit in facilitating the gang’s activities.
